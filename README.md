## Overview

**Economy Behind Blockchain**

Each blockchain has the currency with it to incentivise people mining/working/validating on the blocks. Rising cost of the coins makes a blockchain famous and invites more users towards it.  Same is the logic why people may adopt a new blockchain. 

Blochain and crypto going hand in hand. They complement it each other, and it's hard to imagine one exist without the other. 

**Coin vs Token** 

Cryptocurrencies coins are the native asset of a blockchain like BTC, RBTC, or ETH, whereas tokens are built on an existing blockchain, using smart contracts. Consider coin as self owned car vs token as rental car.
