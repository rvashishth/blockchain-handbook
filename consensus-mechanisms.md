## Models

### Proof of Work

> blockchains: Bitcoin

All reward goes to miner who completes the block first. Other competing minors gets nothing.

### Proof of Stack

> blockchains: Ethereum

### Delegated Proof of Stack

### Proof of Space and Time/ Proof of capacity

> Blockchains: - Chia, FileCoin, BitTorrentCoin

### Proof of Weights

### Proof of Authority

### Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance

> Blockchains: Hyperledger, Zilliqa

### Unique Node List

> Blockchains: Ripple

### Direct Acyclic Graph

> Blockchains: IOTA, Nano

### Proof of Storage

### Proof of replication
