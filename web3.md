1. In web3, there’s no centralized database that stores the application state, and there’s no centralized web server where the backend logic resides.
2. In Web 3.0 you can write smart contracts that define the logic of your applications and deploy them onto the decentralized state machine. This means that every person who wants to build a blockchain application deploys their code on this shared state machine.
And the front end? It pretty much stays the same, with some exceptions.
