	Evolution of Web-
	
	1. Web 1.0
		1.  Read only Web
		2. The role of a user was limited to reading information provided by the content producers
		3. A giant library of data sourced together on a screen from computers all across the network for users to browse by clicking around linked text and images.
	2. Web 2.0
		1.  Social Web or read + write web
		2. Every user can be a content producers and content is distributed and shared between sites. Some of the famous Web 2.0 applications are Facebook, Youtube, Flickr, Twitter etc.,
		3. The Internet has become centralised. It's essentially a bunch of closed systems interacting with each other.
	
	3. Issues in Web 2.0
		1. A centralised internet poses a permanent risk -
			§ Data breaches
			§ Cyberterrorism 
		2. Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon  control our conversations, searches, content, media and data. The open forum has become a walled garden
		3. The default business model became to attract users with free stuff and sell access to their eyeballs: advertising
	
	4. Advent  of Blockchain
		1. Blockchains automate trust by removing a centralized system
		2. "Block" refers to data and state being stored in consecutive groups known as "blocks"."Chain" refers to the fact that each block cryptographically references its parent. In other words, blocks get chained together. The data in a block cannot change without changing all subsequent blocks, which would require the consensus of the entire network.
			1. The blockchain is a decentralised digital list (ledger) of who holds what in a network. This can be money, property titles, medical records. Anything someone would care to 'own'.
			2. Decentralised means every user in the network has an up-to-date copy of the ledger.
			3. This makes the records unchangeable. If someone messes with the ledger, the rest of the network rejects it.
			4. New records (blocks) are made unhackable with cryptography.
			5. Cryptography is impossibly complicated math that takes a lot of computing power.
			6. Users providing that computing power are "miners". They get paid in cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin) for securing the ledger.
			7. Mining makes the cryptocurrency scarce, giving it economic value.
			
	
	5.  Web 3.0
		1. Blockchain networks usher in a "new" Internet: web3, which is read + write + own
		2. A new Internet that is owned by all of its users instead of single corporate like Amazon
		3. The idea of a network running applications should sound familiar. Ethereum is a decentralised alternative for the centralised Internet
		4. In the Web3 world, we talk about dApps (Decentralized apps). A Dapp is a software application that runs on a distributed network (Ethereum Blockchain for example)
		
	6. Web 3.0 vs Web 2.0

	7. High Level Architecture of Web 3 Apps / dApps -
		1. in Web 3.0 you write smart contracts that define the logic of your applications and deploy them onto the decentralized state machine. Smart contracts are written in high-level languages, such as Solidity or Vyper.
		2. no single entity controls this decentralized state machine — it is collectively maintained by everyone in the network
		3.  Ethereum Virtual Machine, which executes the logic defined in the smart contracts and processes the state changes that happen on this globally accessible state machine.
		4. the frontend communicates with the application logic defined in smart contracts.

	9. How Frontend Connects to Blockchain
		1. FE is pointed to ethereum node using a library like Ether.js or Web3.js .
		2. TBD
		
	
	
	8. Current Issues in Web 3.0
		1. Scalability – transactions are slower on web3 because they're decentralized. Changes to state, like a payment, need to be processed by a miner and propagated throughout the network
		2. UX – interacting with web3 applications can require extra steps, software, and education. This can be a hurdle to adoption.
		3. Accessibility – the lack of integration in modern web browsers makes web3 less accessible to most users.
		4. Cost – most successful dapps put very small portions of their code on the blockchain as it's expensive.
